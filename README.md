# graphpaper
A simple and completely open source browser based graph paper editor.

To use the tool, visit https://epswartz.github.io/graphpaper/

I did not create the majority of this tool, only the download/upload functionality. The version I started with is by Tom Maitland, and can be found here: http://tommaitland.net/2012/07/online-graph-paper-tool/ . Tom states that he started with a version from someone called Garrett Bartley (Tom changed from imperial to metric units), but the link he provides gives 404.

In any case, this is open source as are Tom and Garrett's versions.
